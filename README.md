### 🌏 Why we create nubarchiva and open-source?
nubarchiva is an open-source application that allows anyone or any institution, regardless of their size or resources,
to have access to an archival management tool.

The objective of nubarchiva is to make the preservation of collective memory and informational heritage possible for
future generations.

### What do we want to change in the archival landscape?
A significant number of institutions lack appropriate computer tools to manage their archival collections.

* The deficiencies can be as basic as the absence of a management tool beyond a spreadsheet.

* In other cases, the tool they use has become outdated and does not provide functionalities such as publication or
  adaptation to the cataloging of electronic documentation following established legal standards.

* There are also cases where the tool only manages physical archives and lacks integration capabilities with external
  systems, such as record processing systems.

* Digital documents in formats unsuitable for preservation and dissemination: obsolete formats, non-standard formats, etc.

* Complete lack or difficulties in accessing archived collections.
